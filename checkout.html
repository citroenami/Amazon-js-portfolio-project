    <!-- The difference between src="scripts/checkout.js" and src="/scripts/checkout.js" lies in the interpretation 
      of the path. src="scripts/checkout.js": This is a relative path. It tells the browser to look 
      for the "checkout.js" file in a subdirectory called "scripts" within the current directory. 
      If your HTML file is in the root directory, this path indicates that the "scripts" directory is a subdirectory
      of the current location. src="/scripts/checkout.js": This is an absolute path. It tells the browser 
      to look for the "checkout.js" file in the root directory directly within a subdirectory called "scripts". 
      !!! The leading "/" signifies the root directory. !!!
      Which one you use depends on your project structure and how you want to organize your files:
      If your HTML file is in the root directory and the "scripts" folder is also in the root directory, 
      you can use src="scripts/checkout.js" because it's a relative path from the current location.
      If your "scripts" folder is in the root directory, but your HTML file is in a subdirectory, 
      you might want to use src="/scripts/checkout.js" to provide an absolute path from the root.
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev@1.0.1/hello.js"></script>
      we can load external library using script tag
      generally we load external libraries first 
      !!! if we load e.l. like this, it can cause naming conflict so
      use as module instead!
      to include e.l. as module we use ESM version !!!
      After including this script in your HTML, the hello function 
      become part of the global scope. You can then use these
      in any other script included in the HTML file, or in the
      browser's console.-->
